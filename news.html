            <p2> Hello I develop games and software for a hobby. I enjoy doing this type of thing and I thought that some other people might enjoy some of my work so I decided to put it up online. I am not all that experanced yet, so most of this is a big learning process for me and I hope that one day it gets to the point were I dont need to go googleLing around to try and teach myself everything. Granted that since this is all on my own it will take some time for things to be updated. I have many cool ideas and features at the moment but it takes a lot more time then I thought it would to do some of the things that before I thought were way simpler. I hope you enjoy my work and join my discord channel to let me know of any bugs or any suggestions that I could do to make the experance on any of my projects better for everyone... Im just going to do a shameless plug of my youtube channel at :: Thanks so much.
